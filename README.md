# artistplays-mapreduce

## Exercise:
Create a list of Artist/Band and number of plays on each day.

### MapReduce:

For this type of analyses, we want to focus on words that carry meaning: names, nouns, and verbs. Words like the, of, and and occur more than any other words in 
English, and if you arenâ€™t going to be using them, why keep track of them? 

Use a list of stop words to filter out those most-frequent tokens. Anything on the list is removed from the stream of input tokens before any further processing is done.
